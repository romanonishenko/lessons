         <p class="head__body">NASA's Apollo missions and Artemis program reflect humanity's long obsession with Earth's
            satellite. As it trails across the sky, the illuminated disk of the Moon moves through its phases—from new
            Moon
            (dark) to crescent (partially lit) to gibbous (mostly lit) to full Moon (fully lit) and back again. Cultures
            have been tracking this lunar cycle for tens of thousands of years, and records of those rhythms have
            provided
            a way to mark the passage of time.</p>

         <p class="main__text">Of course, the Moon’s prominence in the night sky has influenced humanity for millennia.
            Associating it with different deities, cultures all over the world revered it. In numerous cultures—as
            exemplified in Korean mythology—the Sun and Moon were often connected as siblings or companions of some
            sort, and almost always each was assigned a separate gender.</p>
         <p class="main__body">Moon deities were both gods and a goddesses in different faiths around the world. Some
            of the best known were female, like Selene, worshipped by the ancient Greeks who believed she drove the Moon
            in her chariot across the sky each night. The Chinese revered the goddess Chang’e, whose origin story is a
            key part of China’s modern-day celebration of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which celebrates the brightest full
            Moon of the year. In ancient Egypt, the moon was male embodied by the gods Khonshu and Thoth. Chandra, the
            Hindu god of the moon (also known as Soma), was also believed to control fertility and plants.</p>

         <p class="foot__text">
            When looking at the Moon, people often look for different things—shapes, animals, and even people. Their
            perceptions stem from ancient times. The glowing full Moon in the night sky features darker and lighter
            patches of terrain. In the areas between light and dark, humans envision known objects in the shapes of the
            unknown. Many Western cultures see a man’s eyes, nose, and mouth in the dark patches of the lunar disk, the
            so-called Man in the Moon. Some Chinese heritage records a rabbit on the surface while other legends speak
            of a toad. People in old England saw a man carrying a lantern. The Maori people of New Zealand looked for a
            woman with a bundle of gourds.
